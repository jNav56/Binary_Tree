# Binary_Tree

In this project, I implement a binary tree and searching methods. I explore the implations of Binary Trees and learn how to use create methods that optimize the ability to search, add, remove, and list nodes with special attributes.

The file of BinarySearchTree.java is the implementation of the whole project. To make easier to view, multiple other java files were created to highlight important classes and methods.

## Key Feautures

- Programmed in Java
- Used Recursion Implementations
- Used Simple Iteration Implementations
- Used Binary Tree Implementations
- Created and Utilized Nodes 

## Data Structure Class

This course deepened my knowledge of software design through the lenses of an object-oriented perspective. I learned to implemented commmon data structures to organize and manipulate data such as linked lists, recursion, binary trees, and hash tables to list a few. I was made aware of the tradeoffs software developers have to deal with when designing projects and how to handle them. The class also allowed students to explore algorithms and structures in standard code.
